               Hello, My name is Rebecca. I am a Full Stack Student Devloper at Columbia University.
               I am coming to web devlopment from a career as a Ortho Neuro Trauma Nurse in the Metro Detroit area. I love learning new skills 
               and am excited to be on this journey. I hope to bring my skills and hard working ethic that I have devloped as critical care nurse to
               my web devlopment career. Besides being a nurse I am Mom to Three busy boys, I enjoy going on adventures, reading books, talking about Star Wars, trying new foods and playing games with my friends
